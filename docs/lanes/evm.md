# Lane: evm

Owns `src/execution/evm`. Reference: revm, op-revm, base/base `crates/execution/evm`,
`crates/common/evm*`, `crates/common/precompiles`.

## Backlog
- [x] Core interpreter: stack (fixed 1024), memory (bounded, expansion gas), bytecode analysis (jumpdest bitmap, cached), dispatch via tail-call/computed-goto style switch; all opcodes through Cancun/Prague/Osaka (PUSH0, MCOPY, TLOAD/TSTORE, BLOBHASH, BLOBBASEFEE, CLZ...).
- [ ] Gas schedule per fork, warm/cold access lists (EIP-2929), refunds (EIP-3529), SSTORE net metering (EIP-2200), call gas 63/64, init-code limits (EIP-3860).
- [x] `Host`/state interface (account, storage, code, block hashes, logs, journal with revert checkpoints) — define here as a small Zig interface; trie-db lane implements the backend. Include an in-memory backend for tests.
- [x] CALL/CALLCODE/DELEGATECALL/STATICCALL/CREATE/CREATE2/SELFDESTRUCT (EIP-6780) with explicit frame stack (no recursion), max depth 1024.
- [ ] Transaction-level execution: intrinsic gas, nonce/balance checks, EIP-1559 fee handling, blob txs, EIP-7702 authorizations, access lists, coinbase/base-fee payments.
- [ ] OP-stack semantics: deposit tx processing (mint, no fee, gas accounting by fork, failed-deposit nonce bump), L1 cost charging to L1FeeVault, BaseFeeVault/SequencerFeeVault, operator fee (Isthmus), Base-specific changes in base/base.
- [ ] Precompile dispatch wired to `common.crypto` with per-fork sets and gas.
- [ ] ethereum/tests GeneralStateTests runner (`just vectors`), pass rate tracked in this file.
- [ ] Differential fuzzing harness (random bytecode, seeded) + `std.testing.fuzz` targets.
- [ ] Performance: benchmark snailtracer/erc20 style workloads; aim beyond revm.

## Decisions
- revm architecture: `State` (journaled cache, `state.zig`) over a `Database` vtable that the
  trie-db lane implements; `MemoryDatabase` backs tests. The interpreter talks to the concrete
  `State` (no vtable on the hot path).
- Interpreter is instantiated per fork (`comptime fork`) with labeled-switch threaded dispatch
  (`continue :dispatch`); stack bounds and static gas are comptime per opcode.
- Static allocation: frames, 1025 stacks, shared memory, analysis arena, return buffer, journal,
  logs, code store and state maps are sized at init. Exceeding a state/journal limit is
  `error.StateFull` (fatal block error, never silent divergence). Memory growth past
  `memory_bytes_max` halts as out-of-gas (unreachable under realistic gas limits).
- Warmth and EIP-2200 "original" values are stamped with a tx id (O(1) tx start). Storage
  wipes bump a per-account `storage_epoch`; stale slots re-read from db (epoch 0) or as zero.
- Berlin+ static gas for BALANCE/EXT*/SLOAD/CALL* is the warm cost; cold adds the difference.
- Failed CALL pre-checks (depth, balance) return the full child gas including the stipend
  (geth/revm behavior). CREATE collisions consume the child gas.
- EIP-7610 (storage non-empty collision) is not yet checked: needs a db storage-root hint.
- Precompiles not yet implemented fail the call (tracked under the precompile item).

## Log
- 2026-11-05: core interpreter, gas schedule, journaled state, frame stack, CREATE/CALL
  family, EIP-7702 call delegation, identity/sha256 precompiles; end-to-end tests.
